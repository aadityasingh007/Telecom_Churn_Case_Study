## Business Problem Overview

In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer churn is a significant challenge. Telecom companies face an average annual churn rate of 15-25%. Given the high cost of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones, reducing churn has become a top priority.

The project focuses on analyzing customer-level data from a leading telecom company to build predictive models for identifying high-risk churn customers and identifying key indicators of churn.

## Understanding and Defining Churn

Churn is the phenomenon of customers switching from one telecom service provider to another. It can be defined differently depending on the payment model:

- Postpaid Model: Customers inform the existing operator when switching, making it easy to identify churn.

- Prepaid Model: Customers can stop using services without notice, making churn prediction more challenging.

This project is primarily based on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, where the prepaid model is prevalent.

## Definitions of Churn

Churn can be defined in various ways:

- Revenue-Based Churn: Customers not utilizing revenue-generating facilities for a specified time.

- Usage-Based Churn: Customers with zero usage (incoming or outgoing) for a certain period.

This project uses the usage-based definition to identify churn.

## High-Value Churn

In the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% of customers (high-value customers). Reducing churn among high-value customers can significantly reduce revenue loss.

## Project Description

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry, focusing on high-value customers. By analyzing customer behavior and usage patterns, predictive models will be built to identify customers at risk of churn. The project will also determine key indicators of churn for high-value customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer-level data, including usage patterns, recharge behavior, and demographic information.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of the project is to develop predictive models that can:

- Identify high-value customers at risk of churn.
- Determine the key factors influencing churn.
- Help telecom companies take proactive measures to retain high-value customers and reduce revenue leakage.

## Project Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to understand customer behavior and patterns.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for modeling.
4. Model Building: Developing predictive models to identify high-value churn customers.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. Interpretation: Identifying key indicators of churn.
7. Recommendations: Providing actionable insights to reduce churn among high-value customers.
